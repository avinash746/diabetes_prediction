Diabetes is a chronic disease with the potential to cause a worldwide health care crisis.Diabetes is a disease caused due to the increase level of blood glucose. This high blood glucose produces the symptoms of frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. Diabetes is a one of the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, amputations, heart failure and stroke. 
The accuracy of the model using each of the algorithms is calculated. Then the one with a good accuracy is taken as the model for predicting the diabetes.
So, basically the perspective of this project is to check whether the user is diabetic or not with the help of glucose level,BMI ,blood pressure and no.of pregnancies.
svm is used to check the accuracy and the user interactive interface created with the help of steamlit.
